    q: 'Do I need GoHighLevel already set up?',
    a: "No. I build the complete system end-to-end: the instant-quote funnel, the pricing logic behind it, the GHL pipeline and CRM, and every follow-up automation. You don't need anything in place first — and when native GHL isn't enough, I write the custom code that is.",
  },
  {
    q: 'How much does a system like this cost?',
    a: 'Every build is scoped to the business — the services you offer, your pricing logic, and the automations you need. Book a free funnel website audit and I\'ll map exactly what your system looks like before you commit to anything.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Who have you built this for?',
    a: "I built the complete GHL automation system for my own family's business — DJ Property & Cleaning Services in Albury–Wodonga — and for Melbourne High Pressure Cleaning. I learned it by building it for my own family first.",
  },
  {
    q: 'What happens to a lead after they submit a quote?',
    a: 'The lead drops straight into a GHL pipeline with auto-tagging and stage management — nothing falls through the cracks. From there, SMS and email follow-up sequences, smart booking reminders, and post-job review requests run automatically while you\'re on the truck.',
